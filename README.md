# String Replace

Replaces contents in a string with provided input.

## Basics

String Replace accepts three quoted arguments:
1) The string whose contents will be modified
2) The sub-string to replace
3) What to replace #2 with


## How-tos

### Build a Binary

You can use the installed `odin` binary to build one for you, using the 
command you'd expect. Alternatively, use the bundled `build.sh` script.
It will remove any existing `string-replace` binaries.

### Run Tests

Execute `odin test tests/` or use the bundled `test.sh` script.

### Code Analysis

There isn't much here for that, just use the `vet.sh` script.
